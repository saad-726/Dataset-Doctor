# Dataset Doctor 🧠

Dataset Doctor is a notebook-based ML tool to analyze dataset quality issues
such as missing values, class imbalance, correlation, outliers, and target leakage.

## Why this matters
Most ML models fail due to bad data, not bad algorithms.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements
3. Open Dataset_Doctor.ipynb
4. Replace dataset path and target column

## Checks included
- Missing values
- Class imbalance
- Duplicate rows
- Feature correlation
- Outliers
- Target leakage

## Future roadmap
- Convert notebook into Python package
- Add CLI
- Add visual reports
